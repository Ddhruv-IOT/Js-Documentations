# CodingStandards-React-Node-EJS

!! - This ReadME just serves as an example - !!

## Introduction

Welcome to the Coding Standards repository for React.js, Node.js, and EJS! This repository aims to document the coding standards, best practices, and conventions to follow when working with these technologies. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across projects.

## Coding Standards

### React.js
- Follow the [official React.js style guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/style-guide.html).
- Use functional components over class components wherever possible.
- Organize files by feature or functionality, not by type.
- Utilize React Hooks for state management and side effects.
- Ensure proper prop types validation.
- Use JSX syntax for components.

### Node.js
- Adhere to the [Node.js style guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide).
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
- Follow the CommonJS module pattern for code organization.
- Utilize npm scripts for task automation.
- Implement error handling consistently.
- Leverage ES6 features such as arrow functions and template literals.

### EJS
- Maintain separation of concerns; keep logic out of EJS templates.
- Use includes and partials for reusable components.
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.
- Utilize layout files for consistent page structure.
- Minimize logic in templates; keep them simple and readable.

## Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Break down complex functionalities into smaller, reusable modules.
- **Consistency**: Follow naming conventions consistently throughout the codebase.
- **Documentation**: Document code using JSDoc for JavaScript and appropriate comments for JSX and EJS.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests using Jest for React.js components and Mocha/Chai for Node.js backend.
- **Version Control**: Utilize Git for version control and follow a branching strategy like Gitflow.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure adherence to standards and identify improvements.

## Writing Styles

- **JavaScript**: Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
- **CSS/SCSS**: Utilize BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for naming CSS classes.
- **HTML/EJS**: Use semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Comments**: Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Callback Hell**: Avoid deeply nested callbacks by using Promises or async/await.
- **Magic Numbers/Strings**: Refrain from using hard-coded numbers or strings without context.
- **Spaghetti Code**: Keep code modular and avoid excessive interdependencies.
- **Premature Optimization**: Optimize code only when necessary; prioritize readability and maintainability.
- **Over-Engineering**: Keep solutions simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
